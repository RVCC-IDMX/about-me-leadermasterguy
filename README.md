## Intro
My name is Nicholas Trilone, and this website was created as part of my Web Dev 1 class(built throughout the class, and submitted as a final). 


## Project Description
This website is designed to be 'About Me', with sections for a biography, a list of hobbies, personal photos, a personal video, and a 'contact me' section, as well as a link to my GitHub account. It was build piece by piece, as I learned new website development skills in class, and was tweaked to clean up past mistakes, ensure consistency, and focus on a responsive design(one that works for a number of device sizes). Because of the cascading nature of CSS, I ended up almost entirely remaking my style sheets leading up to the final version, to remove redundant and conflicting code, create proper comments, and switch to a mobile-first approach. I was able to clearly see how far I had come based on the increasing number of 'mistakes' I noticed as I looked at older code.

In making the Bio, and Lit(replaced by Blog) sections, I learned basic text styling skills. The Hobbies section utilized lists, and showed me the ways to style them. The Hero and Gallery sections taught me how to insert, and eventually format images. The short video in the Gallery section, and the Footer taught me how to embed media(videos and links respectively). The Contact Me section covered using forms, as well as data inputting and recieiving. The Navbar taught me about website navigation, and its hamburger menu taught me a few new clever ways to use inputs and media queries. Finally, as the topic I selected for my Blog section was Image Hover Events, I was able to additionally learn how to utilize those.


## Project Color Scheme
The website primarily uses a purple and yellow color scheme, with black used as an accent.
Purple and yellow are complimentary colors, which allows for proper contrast, and I quite like black+purple and black+yellow aesthetically.

The colors labeled as A and B are used for text, with A being for headers and other important text, while B is for 'normal' text(like in the Bio, Hobbies, and Blog sections). C is the primary background color, while D is used to outline certain elements. Color E is used only for the footer. Color F, which is a pure black, is used to outline elements, shadow text, and for the footer text(on the lighter purple, light yellow doesn't show up very well, and darker yellows aren't to my liking). G is a lighter black used for the navbar background. I is a slightly lighter yellow that is used for the navbar links, and hamburger menu.
H and A are the colors present in the logo.

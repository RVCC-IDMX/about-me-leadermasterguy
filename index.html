        <h2>Excerpt From Dracula</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            "Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only
            because it is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are,
            very dear to me. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide
            when you came from the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life.
            I want you to see now, and with the eyes of a very happy wife,
            whither duty has led me; so that in your own married life you too
            may be all happy as I am. My dear, please Almighty God, your life
            may be all it promises: a long day of sunshine, with no harsh wind,
            no forgetting duty, no distrust. I must not wish you no pain, for
            that can never be; but I do hope you will be always as happy as I am
            now. Good-bye, my dear. I shall post this at once, and, perhaps,
            write you very soon again. I must stop, for Jonathan is waking--I
            must attend to my husband! "Oceans of love and millions of kisses,
            and may you soon be in your own home with your husband. I wish you
            could be coming home soon enough to stay with us here. The strong
            air would soon restore Jonathan; it has quite restored me. I have an
            appetite like a cormorant, am full of life, and sleep well. You will
            be glad to know that I have quite given up walking in my sleep. I
            think I have not stirred out of my bed for a week, that is when I
            once got into it at night. Arthur says I am getting fat. By the way,
            I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here. We have such walks and
            drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishing together; and
            I love him more than ever. He tells me that he loves me more, but I
            doubt that, for at first he told me that he couldn't love me more
            than he did then. But this is nonsense. There he is, calling to me.
            So no more just at present from your loving
          </p>

            20 August.--The case of Renfield grows even more interesting. He has
            now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his
            passion. For the first week after his attack he was perpetually
            violent. Then one night, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and
            kept murmuring to himself: "Now I can wait; now I can wait." The
            attendant came to tell me, so I ran down at once to have a look at
            him. He was still in the strait-waistcoat and in the padded room,
            but the suffused look had gone from his face, and his eyes had
            something of their old pleading--I might almost say,
            "cringing"--softness. I was satisfied with his present condition,
            and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated, but
            finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strange
            thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for,
            coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking
            furtively at them:--

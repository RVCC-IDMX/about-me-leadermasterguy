        <h2>Biography:</h2>
        <p>I am Nicholas Trilone, the creator of this website, and a Web Dev 1 student. I took this course to both fill a computer elective need, as well as to expand my abilties(after all, who doesn't need a website?). Even if you don't <em>need</em> a website, understanding how they function can be plenty useful in everyday life, especially when working with computers for a living.</p>
        <p>I am in my final semester of Raritan Valley Community College, working towards an Associate of Applied Science in Computer Programming. After this semester I plan on working for awhile before continuing my education(at least a bachelors degree in computer science is my goal).</p>
        <p>I plan on continuing my pursuit of programming and computer software engineering, regardless of what I end up doing in life. I've been interested in computers since I was young, so focusing on it as either as a career, or as a hobby makes the most sense to me. </p>
        <p>I spend my free time primarily playing video games with and going out with friends. Recently, I've been able to spend a lot more time with my friend groups in real life, as disposable income and transport have become more accessible, and pandemic concerns are shrinking.</p>
        <p>I tend to like roguelikes/roguelites, horror(especially psychological), and strategy games, although I am willing to play most genres(especially if they are co-op/multiplayer).</p>
        <p>I love animals, and have a particular soft spot for cats. My household has three cats, named Lizzy(my cat), Oreo, and Casper, who are all pictured below.</p>
        <p>I have an older brother, and three younger half siblings(two brothers and one sister). I currently live at home with my father and brother.</p>

      <!--Blog: Essay on Image Hover Effects(Previously Lit)-->
      <article id="lit">
        <h2>What Are Image Hover Effects?</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Image hover effects are specific css effects that are added to elements via the ':hover' selector. In simpler terms, it allows for dynamic changes in a website when a certain image is hovered over.
            For a very basic examples, you can look at the images in "Gallery", which grow in size slightly when hovered over(when on desktop view). Just as the ':hover' selector can be used to modify text when its hovered
            over, images work in the same way.
          </p>
          <p>
            When applying the hover image effects to my Gallery, I tried to apply the knowledge I had of text hover effects(from the links in the Navbar and Footer), with a high level of success. I marked the specific
            image elements with a particular class within my html, then applied css changes to that class, given the ':hover' selector. I simply changed the scale of the image slightly(105%) when the images are hovered
            over to give a small amount of user feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            Image hover effects are a relatively easy way to add interactivity and responsiveness to a website without(necessarily) vastly changing its function. They can vary from very minor cosmetic effects, to
            complex animations, to function-relevant changes. Although there is always a risk of overdoing it, adding image hover events to a website effectively can vastly improve it, both in terms of cosmetics and
            functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of the simplicity that the initial implementation held, I decided to look into more interesting effects to apply to the images. I looked into image filters(which include brightness, sepia,
            contrast, hue, and blurs), as well as image transformations(which include translations, rotations, skews, and scaling).
          </p>
          <p>
            Below this Blog is three yellow squares that can be hovered over to produce effects. Tapping/Clicking the boxes will also produce the same effect, for those who are on devices that cannot hover over an image.
            The first one becomes partially transparent when hovered over, utilizing the opacity filter. In reality, because of the simplicity of the example, the square just becomes a light purple
            color(as yellow being partially opaque on top of purple makes a lighter purple). The second square is skewed along both the X-axis, and the Y-axis when hovered over, which vastly changes its shape. Finally,
            the third box is simply rotated 45 degrees when hovered over.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only issues I ran into when attempting to implement these effects were unexpected behaviors with the 'matrix' transformation. This transformation is a combination of scale, skew, and translate, on both the
            X-axis and Y-axis, meaning that it takes in 6 values. Because the order of these parameters aren't entirely intuitive(scaleX, skewY, skewX, scaleY, translateX, translateY), when experimenting, I often found myself
            misplacing values, leading to a number of strange effects. Once, by mistakingly setting scaleY to 0, I discovered that the square would rapidly flash when hovering over it. Hovering over the box would cause it to
            disappear(because its scaleY = 0), which would mean that it is no longer being hovered over, causing it to go back to normal, before starting the loop again. A similar, although less extreme version of this can
            be observed when hovering over the second square's top right or bottom left corners, as the skew effect changes the bounds of the box.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even these image hover effects are only scratching the surface, as animations and effect timings can be created through css, allowing for an extreme level of creative expression, beyond simple filters, transformations,
            and style changes.
          </p>
